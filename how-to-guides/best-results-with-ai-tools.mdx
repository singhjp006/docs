# How to get the best results with KwikUI and AI coding tools

When you're building apps or websites with KwikUI and pairing it with modern AI coding tools like **Lovable, Bolt, Windsurf, v0, Replit, or Cursor**, your workflow can go from slow and manual to lightning-fast. But just like any powerful setup, the results depend on how you use it.

If you've ever pasted a prompt and got back code that didn't quite match your vision. Or worse, code that drifted away from your design over time. You know the frustration. The good news? A few simple strategies can dramatically improve your results and keep your workflow sharp.

Here's a breakdown of four proven tips for getting the best outcomes when using KwikUI with your favorite AI coding tools.

## 1. One Page = One Prompt

Don't overload your AI tool with too much at once. Instead:
- Work on one page at a time.
- Copy and paste the KwikUI prompt for that page directly into your chosen tool.
- Let it generate the code for that page before moving on.

This keeps your builds clean, modular, and easy to refine. Think of it as chunking your project into manageable steps instead of dumping the entire thing into the AI at once.

## 2. Keep Context Fresh

AI tools are powerful, but they can "drift" if you keep stacking prompts or edits without resetting. To prevent this:
- Always re-paste the original KwikUI prompt when you notice the tool losing alignment.
- This ensures your layout, components, and---

It's a simple reset trick that saves hours of debugging later.

## 3. Be Explicit About Your Stack

AI coding tools are versatile, but they're not mind readers. If you want a specific framework, library, or style system, tell the tool upfront. For example:
- Add a line like _"Use plain HTML/CSS"_ if you want simple markup.
- Or _"Use React + Tailwind"_ if that's your stack of choice.

This is especially important for IDE-based AI tools like Cursor, which can mix approaches unless guided clearly. Being explicit means you'll get code that actually works with your workflow from the start.

## 4. Iterate and Refine

The first code output is rarely perfect, and that's okay. What matters is iteration:
- After the initial generation, ask your tool to refine the code.
- Focus on spacing, states, and accessibility.
- Use KwikUI's detailed prompt structure as a checklist for improvements.

By iterating, you're training the AI to deliver cleaner, production-ready results instead of just rough drafts.

## The Bottom Line

KwikUI already makes front-end building faster and smarter—but when combined with tools like Lovable, Bolt, or Cursor, it becomes unstoppable. The secret is in how you prompt, reset, and refine.

Remember:
- **One page = one prompt.**
- **Re-paste to keep context fresh.**
- **Be explicit about your stack.**
- **Iterate until it feels right.**

Follow these tips, and you'll not only save time but also create cleaner, scalable, and more consistent code. All without the usual headaches of AI-assisted development.

**Ready to try it yourself?** Fire up KwikUI with your favorite coding tool and put these tips into action. You'll be surprised at how quickly "_idea to interface_" becomes your new normal.of debugging later.
