Sometimes when using [KwikUI](https://www.kwikui.com/), the AI may miss detecting a page during the auto-scan process. Don't worry! This doesn't mean you're stuck. You can easily add a page manually and ensure it's factored into your final detailed prompts.

## Why You Might Need to Add a Page Manually

While KwikUI's AI is designed to detect pages automatically, there can be cases where:

- The page structure is unconventional (e.g., hidden landing pages or microsites)
- The page is new and wasn't included in the last crawl
- The screenshots weren't uploaded during the initial scan

In such cases, adding a page manually ensures no important part of your website is left out when generating prompts.

## Steps to Add a Page Manually

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Pages Detected Panel">
    Once KwikUI finishes scanning, head to the **Pages Detected** panel. This is where the tool lists every page it has already recognized. If you notice something's missing, this is where you'll fix it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Add Page'">
    Inside the panel, click the **Add Page** button. This allows you to create a new entry for the page that wasn't auto-detected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the Page Name">
    Next, you'll need to name your page. Choose something descriptive and clear so it's easy to identify later. Examples include:
    - _Careers_
    - _Pricing_
    - _Blog_
    - _Contact Us_
    
    This label will serve as the reference point for prompts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Screenshots">
    Now, upload screenshots of the new page. These visuals are essential because KwikUI uses them to analyze layouts, designs, and UI components before generating prompts.
    
    <Tip>
      Make sure the screenshots are clear and capture the entire page (including sections that might be below the fold).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Project">
    Once the page is added and screenshots are uploaded, click **Create Project**. KwikUI will now:
    - Factor in the new page's screenshots
    - Create a page-specific prompt tailored to its unique layout and purpose
    - Ensure the final output reflects the entire website, not just the auto-detected parts
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Stay in Control

Missing pages don't have to disrupt your workflow. By adding them manually, you're ensuring completeness and accuracy in the generated prompts.

<Note>
KwikUI's flexibility allows you to stay in control—even when the AI overlooks something. So the next time the system misses a page like _Blog_ or _Careers_, you'll know exactly what to do.
