# Where do I find my projects in KwikUI?

If you're new to KwikUI, one of the first things you'll want to know is where to find your projects. Whether you're managing multiple landing pages, testing out new prompts, or generating production-ready code, your projects act as the central hub.

In this quick guide, we'll walk you through exactly how to locate and manage your projects inside KwikUI.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Projects Section

At the top of your KwikUI dashboard, you'll find the main header. From there, simply click on **Projects**. This takes you straight to the dedicated projects area, where all your work is neatly organized.

## Step 2: Explore the Project List

Once inside the Projects section, you'll see a list of all your existing projects. Each entry includes:
- **Project Name** – so you can quickly identify what you're working on.
- **Project Overview** – a quick snapshot of the pages, prompts, and assets you've created.

This list view makes it easy to stay on top of multiple projects at once.

## Step 3: Open a Project for Details

Click on any project in the list to open it. Inside, you'll be able to:
- **View Pages**: Check all the pages you've built within that project.
- **Copy Prompts**: Quickly copy and reuse your prompts for future projects.

This is where KwikUI really shines, making it effortless to go from idea to implementation.

## Why This Matters

Finding your projects quickly isn't just about convenience. It's about **speed to market**. With KwikUI's streamlined interface, you don't waste time searching around. Instead, you can focus on testing, building, and launching faster.

Your projects are the backbone of your work in KwikUI. By heading to the **Projects** tab in the top header, you'll have everything you need at your fingertips. Be it pages, prompts, or even production-ready code.

So the next time you log in, start by checking your **Projects**. It's your command center for building smarter, faster, and more efficiently with KwikUI.
