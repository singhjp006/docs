When working with KwikUI, uploading images is a simple yet precise process. To maintain security, performance, and consistency, KwikUI enforces strict validation rules for all uploads.

Whether you're setting up your main project or customizing individual pages, the same checks apply. Here's everything you need to know.

## Supported File Formats

KwikUI only accepts a limited set of image file formats to ensure compatibility and security. Currently, you can upload:

- **JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)**
- **PNG (.png)**
- **GIF (.gif)**
- **WebP (.webp)**

<Warning>
If your file is in another format (such as TIFF, BMP, or SVG), you'll need to convert it before uploading.
</Warning>

## File Size Limitations

To keep your projects lightweight and fast, each image must be **under 4 MB**. This applies to both the main homepage upload and individual page uploads.

<Note>
Large images can slow down your site, so compressing them before uploading is highly recommended.
</Note>

If your image is too large, you'll see this error message:

<Warning>
"Image exceeds the 4 MB limit. Please upload a smaller file."
</Warning>

## Upload Quantity

KwikUI currently only allows one image upload at a time:

- 1 file for the main homepage upload
- 1 file per detected page

This keeps project management straightforward and prevents accidental bulk uploads.

## Security & Validation

KwikUI takes security seriously. Every uploaded file is checked against two criteria:

1. **MIME type**: ensures the file's actual content matches its declared type
2. **File extension**: double-checks that the file format is correct

<Info>
This dual validation prevents malicious uploads and ensures only genuine image files are accepted.

## Common Error Messages

KwikUI provides clear feedback when something goes wrong with your upload. Here are the two most common messages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File Too Large">
    **Error:** _"Image exceeds the 4 MB limit. Please upload a smaller file."_
    
    **Solution:** Compress your image using tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh before uploading.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Unsupported Format">
    **Error:** _"Unsupported image format. Please upload JPG, PNG, GIF or WebP."_
    
    **Solution:** Convert your file to one of the supported formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Consistent Validation

It doesn't matter if you're uploading the main project image or images for individual pages—KwikUI applies the same validation rules across the board. This ensures a consistent and predictable experience.

## Best Practices for Smooth Uploads
