# What are the file upload requirements and limitations in KwikUI?

When working with KwikUI, uploading images is a simple yet precise process. To maintain security, performance, and consistency, KwikUI enforces strict validation rules for all uploads.

Whether you're setting up your main project or customizing individual pages, the same checks apply. Here's everything you need to know.

## Supported File Formats

KwikUI only accepts a limited set of image file formats to ensure compatibility and security. Currently, you can upload:
- **JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)**
- **PNG (.png)**
- **GIF (.gif)**
- **WebP (.webp)**

If your file is in another format (such as TIFF, BMP, or SVG), you'll need to convert it before uploading.

## File Size Limitations

To keep your projects lightweight and fast, each image must be **under 4 MB**. This applies to both the main homepage upload and individual page uploads.

Large images can slow down your site, so compressing them before uploading is highly recommended.

If your image is too large, you'll see this error message:
_"Image exceeds the 4 MB limit. Please upload a smaller file."_

## Single File Upload Only

KwikUI currently only allows one image upload at a time:
- 1 file for the main homepage upload
- 1 file per detected page

This keeps project management straightforward and prevents accidental bulk uploads.

## Security & Validation

KwikUI takes security seriously. Every uploaded file is checked against two criteria:
1. **MIME type**: ensures the file's actual content matches its declared type.
2. **File extension**: double-checks that the file format is correct.

This dual validation prevents malicious uploads and ensures only genuine image files are accepted.

## Error Messages You Might See

KwikUI provides clear feedback when something goes wrong with your upload. Here are the two most common messages:
- **File Too Large:**
  _"Image exceeds the 4 MB limit. Please upload a smaller file."_
- **Unsupported Format:**
  _"Unsupported image format. Please upload JPG, PNG, GIF or WebP."_

If you see either of these, simply adjust your file and try again.

## Consistent Across All Uploads

It doesn't matter if you're uploading the main project image or images for individual pages. KwikUI applies the same validation rules across the board. This ensures a consistent and predictable experience.

## Best Practices for Smooth Uploads

To avoid errors and speed up your workflow, follow these quick tips:
- Use **JPEG or WebP** for faster loading times.
- Compress images with tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh before uploading.
- Stick to the recommended formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP) to avoid rejections.
- Keep file sizes well below **4 MB** whenever possible for optimal performance.

KwikUI's strict upload rules may feel limiting at first, but they're designed to protect your projects and ensure smooth performance.

By sticking to supported formats, compressing images, and keeping files under 4 MB, you'll avoid common upload issues and keep your site running at its best.
