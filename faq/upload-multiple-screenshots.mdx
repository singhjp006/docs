# Can I upload more than one screenshot at a time in KwikUI?

If you're just getting started with KwikUI, you might be wondering: _Can I upload multiple screenshots at once?_ The short answer is **NO**.

KwikUI currently supports one screenshot per upload area at a time. But there's a good reason behind this design choice.

Let's break it down.

## Upload Options in KwikUI

KwikUI gives you two main upload areas:

1. **Main Home Page Upload** → accepts **1 file only**
   - This is where you upload your primary screenshot, usually the homepage or the main UI you're starting with.

2. **Detected Pages Upload** → accepts **1 file per page**
   - Here, you can add supporting screenshots of other pages. Each upload is tied to its specific page, ensuring clean organization.
