If you're just getting started with [KwikUI](https://www.kwikui.com/), you might be wondering: _Can I upload multiple screenshots at once?_ 

The short answer is **NO**.

KwikUI currently supports one screenshot per upload area at a time. But there's a good reason behind this design choice.

Let's break it down.

## Upload Options in KwikUI

KwikUI gives you two main upload areas:

### 1. Main Home Page Upload

<Card title="Main Home Page Upload" icon="house">
  Accepts **1 file only**
  
  This is where you upload your primary screenshot, usually the homepage or the main UI you're starting with.
</Card>

### 2. Detected Pages Upload

<Card title="Detected Pages Upload" icon="files">
  Accepts **1 file per page**
  
  Here, you can add supporting screenshots of other pages. Each upload is tied to its specific page, ensuring clean organization.
</Card>

## Why This Approach?

The single-upload design ensures:

- **Clear organization** - Each screenshot maps to exactly one page
- **No confusion** - You always know which screenshot belongs to which page
- **Easy management** - Simple to update or replace individual page screenshots
- **Better accuracy** - KwikUI can process each page with full context

<Note>
While you can't upload multiple files at once, you can add as many pages as you need by uploading screenshots one at a time to their respective upload slots.
</Note>

## Best Practices

To make your workflow smoother:

1. Prepare all screenshots before starting your project
2. Name your files clearly (e.g., `homepage.png`, `pricing.png`, `contact.png`)
3. Upload them in order as you build your project
4. Review each page after uploading to ensure accuracy

<Tip>
The one-at-a-time approach may seem slower initially, but it actually saves time by preventing upload errors and ensuring accurate page-to-screenshot mapping.
