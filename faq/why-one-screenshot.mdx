You might think batch uploads would be faster, but KwikUI's single-screenshot workflow is intentional. Here's why.

## Benefits of Single-Screenshot Upload

  <Card title="Better Organization" icon="folder">
    Each screenshot is stored and tied to a specific prompt, so nothing gets mixed up.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accurate Page Mapping" icon="map">
    By limiting uploads to one per slot, KwikUI ensures every screenshot corresponds to the right detected page.

    This avoids confusion, keeps projects clean, and makes it easy to revisit or edit individual screens later.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What This Means for Your Projects

- If you're designing multiple pages, you'll upload each one separately
- Your home page screenshot goes into the main upload area
- Every additional page screenshot gets its own dedicated upload slot

<Note>
Think of it like building blocks. Each screenshot is placed exactly where it belongs. This keeps your project structured and avoids headaches down the road.
</Note>

## The Bottom Line

So, while KwikUI doesn't support bulk uploading multiple screenshots at once, the one-at-a-time approach is actually a feature, not a limitation. It helps maintain clarity, accuracy, and control over your UI projects.

If you're working on multi-page designs, just upload them one by one, and [KwikUI](https://www.kwikui.com/) will do the heavy lifting of organizing and mapping them correctly.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Keep your screenshots clearly labeled (e.g., _homepage.png, pricing.png, contact.png_) before uploading to speed up your workflow.
