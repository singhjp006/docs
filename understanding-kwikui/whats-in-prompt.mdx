# What's inside a KwikUI-Generated Prompt?

When you click the button, KwikUI doesn't just give you a rough outline. It goes deep into the specifics of how your page should look, feel, and behave. Here's what gets included.

## 1. Layout, Sections & Components

The prompt clearly defines the page layout. From headers and navigation bars to footers and modals. It specifies the sections you'll need and the expected components within each section (like cards, grids, buttons, or forms).

## 2. Content Placeholders & Structure

Instead of leaving you guessing, KwikUI creates content placeholders that tell the AI tool where text, images, or dynamic data should go. It also outlines the structural hierarchy, ensuring content is semantically organized.

## 3. Interactions & States

User interactions are no longer an afterthought. The generated prompt includes details like hover effects, active states for navigation, form behaviors, and even loading or error states. This ensures your final UI isn't static—it's interactive and engaging.

## 4. Responsiveness & Accessibility Notes

KwikUI takes modern standards seriously. That's why every prompt comes with responsiveness guidelines (so your page works beautifully across devices) and accessibility notes (to keep your UI inclusive and compliant with accessibility best practices).

## Copy-Paste Ready for AI Coding Tools

Here's the best part: the prompts KwikUI generates are **copy-paste ready.** You don't need to reword, restructure, or debug the instruction text before feeding it into your AI coding tool. Just copy, paste, and watch as your tool translates the prompt into production-ready code.

It's like skipping the messy brainstorming stage and moving straight into execution. With the confidence that your AI coding partner knows exactly what to build.

## Why It Matters

- **Saves Time:** No more writing long, detailed prompts from scratch.
- **Improves Accuracy:** Reduces miscommunication between you and your AI coding tool.
- **Scales Easily:** Whether you're designing one landing page or an entire product, you can replicate and adapt prompts effortlessly.
- **Bridges Design & Development:** KwikUI makes it easier for non-coders (like designers or marketers) to translate their ideas into developer-friendly input.

Clicking **"Create Project"** in KwikUI is more than just a shortcut—it's a productivity booster. By giving you structured, detailed, and AI-friendly instructions, it helps you build beautiful, functional, and accessible UIs faster than ever.

Next time you're staring at a blank screen, wondering how to explain your design vision to your coding assistant, remember: **_KwikUI has already done the hard work for you._**
