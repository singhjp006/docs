# How does KwikUI decide which pages to suggest?

When you're setting up a new project in KwikUI, one of the first questions that pops up is: _how does it know which pages I might need?_ The answer lies in something deceptively simple yet surprisingly powerful. Your website's **header or navigation bar**.

## The Magic Behind Page Suggestions

KwikUI scans the links and labels in your header or navbar. The place where most websites showcase their key sections. Think of the usual suspects:
- **Home**
- **Features**
- **Pricing**
- **About**
- **Contact**

These sections aren't just random words. They represent the structure of your website, and more importantly, the user journey you want visitors to take. KwikUI uses these labels as a starting point to propose project pages, giving you a ready-to-go foundation instead of a blank canvas.

## Why This Matters

Imagine setting up a site builder or design tool from scratch. You'd spend time deciding which pages to add, what to name them, and how to organize them. By analyzing your existing navigation, KwikUI skips the guesswork and mirrors the layout you've already chosen.

That means:
- **Faster setup** → no manual creation of every page.
- **Consistency** → your project reflects your actual website structure.
- **Flexibility** → it's just a starting point—you stay in control.

## You're Always in Control

KwikUI's suggestions are exactly that—suggestions. You're never locked into them. At any point, you can:
- **Rename** a suggested page to match your preferred terminology.
- **Remove** any page you don't need.
- **Add** new ones that KwikUI didn't surface.

Think of KwikUI as giving you the blueprint. You get to decide whether to build on top of it, tweak it, or redesign it entirely.

## The Bottom Line

At the end of the day, KwikUI's page suggestion feature is about making the first step of building smoother. Instead of starting from scratch, you begin with a project that already feels familiar, aligned with your navigation and website goals.

So the next time you see KwikUI suggest pages, know that it's not random. It's reading your navbar, anticipating your needs, and giving you a smart, structured foundation to launch faster.
