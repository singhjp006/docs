# What happens when I click "Create Project" in KwikUI?

If you've ever used KwikUI, you've probably noticed the magical little button: **"Create Project."**

But what exactly happens behind the scenes when you click it? And why is it such a game-changer for developers, designers, and vibe coders?

Let's break it down.

## The Power of Detailed Prompts

AI coding tools are only as good as the prompts you feed them. A vague prompt often results in incomplete or misaligned code. That's where KwikUI steps in.

With one click, it generates **page-level prompts** that are structured, comprehensive, and optimized to work seamlessly with your favorite AI coding assistants.

Think of it as having a blueprint for your UI—well-thought-out, developer-ready, and clear enough for any AI model to understand.
