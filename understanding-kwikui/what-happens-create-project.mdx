If you've ever used KwikUI, you've probably noticed the magical little button: **"Create Project."**

But what exactly happens behind the scenes when you click it? And why is it such a game-changer for developers, designers, and vibe coders?

Let's break it down.

## The Power of Detailed Prompts

AI coding tools are only as good as the prompts you feed them. A vague prompt often results in incomplete or misaligned code. That's where KwikUI steps in.

With one click, it generates **page-level prompts** that are structured, comprehensive, and optimized to work seamlessly with your favorite AI coding assistants.

<Note>
Think of it as having a blueprint for your UI—well-thought-out, developer-ready, and clear enough for any AI model to understand.

## What Gets Generated

When you click "Create Project," KwikUI processes your uploaded screenshots and analyzes:

- **Visual structure** - Layout patterns, sections, and component hierarchy
- **Navigation elements** - Menu items, links, and page relationships
- **Design patterns** - UI components, spacing, and styling cues
- **Interactive elements** - Buttons, forms, and other user interactions

All of this analysis is then converted into detailed, structured prompts that you can use with tools like:

- Cursor
- Windsurf
- [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/?via=kwikui)
- [Bolt](https://bolt.new/?rid=k8pb24)
- v0
- [Replit](https://replit.com/refer/hellopixorr)

## The Result

You get ready-to-use prompts for each page that include:

✅ Complete layout specifications  
✅ Component descriptions  
✅ Content structure  
✅ Interaction patterns  
✅ Responsive design guidelines  
✅ Accessibility considerations

<Tip>
The prompts are designed to be copy-paste ready—no editing required. Just take them to your favorite AI coding tool and start building.
