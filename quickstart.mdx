Starting your first project in [**KwikUI**](https://www.kwikui.com/) is quick, simple, and requires no coding knowledge. Whether you’re working with a mockup, a site screenshot, or a full design, KwikUI helps you transform it into working prompts and even ReactJS code in just a few clicks.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through every step to create your first project on KwikUI, along with a pro tip to make your results even better.

**Step 1: Sign In to KwikUI**

Head over to [kwikui.com](https://kwikui.com) and log in to your account. If you don’t have one yet, creating a new account only takes a minute.

**Step 2: Start a New Project**

Once inside the dashboard, click on **New Project → Upload**.\
Here, you’ll need to upload either:

- A **mockup** of your website or app, or
- A **screenshot** of your site.

**Pro tip**: Always use a clear, full-width screenshot that includes the entire header or navbar. This ensures KwikUI can detect navigation elements correctly.

**Step 3: Review Suggested Pages**

After your upload, KwikUI will automatically scan your header or navbar to suggest the pages it identifies.

- Review these suggestions carefully.
- Add or remove pages depending on your site structure.

This step saves you time by auto-detecting menus and preventing missed links.

**Step 4: Generate Project**

Next, click on Create Project.

KwikUI will create ready-to-use prompts for each page, which you can later copy into code-generation tools like Lovable, Bolt, or Cursor.

**Step 5: Download the project files**

**<u>For Cursor/ Windsurf:</u>**

From your saved project:

1. Download the project files
2. Put them inside an empty project in cursor.
3. Run @1 file
4. Accept everything.

**<u>For tools like Lovable, replit, v0:</u>**

1. Open the project
2. Copy the contents of the UI files
3. Paste it in lovable one-by-one

**Final Tip for Best Results.**

When uploading your design or screenshot, make sure it captures the full header/navbar clearly. 

You can use KwikSnap, inhouse chrome extension for efficient visible and long form screenshot. This gives KwikUI the context it needs to generate the most accurate page suggestions and prompts.

And that’s it! You’ve created your very first project in KwikUI!

With just a screenshot, KwikUI helps you jump from design to code in minutes, not hours. Whether you’re experimenting with ideas, building prototypes, or generating production-ready NextJS code, this workflow makes it effortless.
